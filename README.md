# Flask-Scaffolding: A Decentralized Flask Framework, By Bixing

## Why Flask-Scaffolding
Many Flask tutorial would teach you to create your blueprint, and then use import statement and register_blueprint startment in main.py, which is good way to use blueprint as a starter, but not a good way for team development.

When developing full-stack flask application, every team member could just use this scaffolding. After finishing individual development task, simply copy and paste your blueprint into the Blueprint folder of the code base.

## How
Every blueprint folder should end with "_bp"
To start your own blurprint, simply copy the sample blueprint, and then change the blueprint name, and then just start coding
